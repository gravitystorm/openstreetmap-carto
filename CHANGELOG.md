## [v2.35.0](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/compare/v2.34.0...v2.35.0) - 2015-09-16

## [v2.34.0](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/compare/v2.33.0...v2.34.0) - 2015-08-28
### Changes
Changes include

- better rendering for highway=path/footway/cycleway - this is the
next iteration of improving how footways and cycleways are
displayed. Unpaved footways are now visible on natural=bare_rock
and there are now three classes: paved, unpaved and unknown surface

- `man_made=bridge` is now rendered

- new rendering for `landuse=quarry`

- `amenity=veterinary` is now rendered

- `amenity=community_centre` is now rendered

- `amenity=prison` and `landuse=military` rendering takes in account area size

- consistent color for boundaries

- tweaked zoom level for `amenity=car_sharing` and `amenity=car_rental`

- Mapnik 3 preparations are now finished. The style now supports Mapnik 3. Most of the work was done on the Mapnik side.

## [v2.33.0](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/compare/v2.32.0...v2.33.0) - 2015-08-14
### Major changes
- A randomized symbology for forests for `natural=wood` and `landuse=forest`

  A long time in the works, this improvement has finally landed. The two
  tags were merged - they are indistinguishable to the data consumer.
  A randomized symbology was first suggested by SK53 at SOTM-EU 2014,
  and this feature would not have happened without his extensive research,
  or imagico's tools for creating an irregular but uniformly distributed
  and periodic dot pattern

- Unification of footway/path and rendering surface of them

   The mess that is highway=path is well-known, and it is necessary
   to do some kind of processing as a data consumer. A distinction is
   now made between paved and unpaved footways.


### Changes
- Mapnik 3 preperations

   The style is not yet fullly tested with Mapnik 3 and we don't claim to
   support it, but several bugs were fixed. Most of the work was done on
   the Mapnik side

- Power area colour adjusted

## [v2.32.0](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/compare/v2.31.0...v2.32.0) - 2015-07-31
# New files

Shapefiles are now used for Antartic ice sheets

### Changes

- Rendering minor roads and service rail later for mid-zoom clarity

   As all residential, unclassified, and service roads in a city became
   mapped the rendered view became over-crowded, bloblike, and difficult
   to read.

- Rendering of Antartic ice sheets from shapefiles

  Ice sheets in Antartica are a bit of a special case, and pre-generated
  shapefiles are now used

- No longer rendering proposed roads

- Better place label order

- meadow/grassland and orchard/vineyard color unification

- Render educational area borders later

- New POI icons
