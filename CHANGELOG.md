### Major changes
- Update Lua tag transforms. (#4032)
    Linestring and polygon decisions have changed and a database reload is required for this update.

### Changes

### Changes
- Remove rendering of barrier=embankment (#4010)

    Embankments are now commonly tagged with man_made=embankment or man_made=dyke

- Remove rendering of barrier=kerb (#3969)

    This feature is not similar to common barriers (fences and walls)

- Remove boundary=protected_area fill color at low zoom levels (#3887)

    Also changes protected area line and text to new `@protected-area`

- Remove polygon fill rendering for barrier=hedge areas (#3844)

    This makes the rendering consistent between walls and hedges as areas

## [v4.24.0](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/compare/v4.23.0...v4.24.0) - 2019-10-25
### Changes
- Create darker river-color for river & canal areas and waterway lines (#3930)

    The color of river, canal, ditch and drain waterway lines
    and river and canal areas is changed to `#8fcadd` (Lch78,21,227)

- Fix rendering of water body labels (#3919)

    Restores rendering of water body labels on points (node features)
    Fixes rendering of natural=bay to use italic font at all z levels
    Cleans up duplicate natural=strait code in water.mss

- Precedence of junctions over POIs (#3915)

    Junction=yes, =motorway and man_made=bridge labels now render before amenity-points
    This prevents icons from blocking the display of these text labels

- Remove rendering of waterway=wadi (#3931)

    The tag waterway=wadi is deprecated, suggested replacement:
    waterway=river/stream + intermittent=yes OR natural=valley

- Move parking to amenity-points layers, change way_pixels limit and initial zoom level (#3923)

    Moved parking features back to amenity-points layers
    Changed parking text intial zoom to z14, as planned in PR #3612
    Change way_pixels limit for parking icon (750) and text (3000)

- Don't use classes anymore (#3912)
- Convert state & country layers to ST_PointOnSurface (#3920)
- Convert addresses to use ST_PointOnSurface (#3898)
- Apply bbox to part of "addresses" query (#3942)

    The 4 changes above are needed to allow use of vector tiles
    ST_PointOnSurface is used to generate a point for labeling
    Classes are removed, replaced with the layer id

- Documentation updates (#3911) & (#3910)
- Code clean-up (#3899) & (#3922)

    Document inner line rendering, update docker documentation
    Clean-up text-placement / marker-placement, remove natural=marsh

## [v4.23.0](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/compare/v4.22.0...v4.23.0) - 2019-9-20

    Also adds salt dots pattern for `wetland=saltmarsh`

## [v4.22.0](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/compare/v4.21.0...v4.22.0) - 2019-08-27
### Changes

- Shop label fixes and use ST_PointOnSurface for building label placement (#3781)

  This fixes some bugs and makes building label placement consistent with shop
  label placement.

- Use `cache-feature: true` to improve performance of layers with attachments (#3838)

- Use retail colour fill on malls (#3790)

- Drop `highway=steps` from zoom 13 (#3825)

  This makes step rendering consistent with footways

- Render `place=locality` from zoom 16 (#3749)

  This fits current usage of the tag and what it is normally tagged on.

- Render `natural=bay` from linear ways (#3754)

- Render administrative boundary labels from relations only (#3762)

- Stop rendering natural=marsh (#3829)

  It is recommended marshes are tagged with `natural=wetland` + `wetland=marsh`

- Use a whitelist for barrier rendering, and render `historic=citywalls` like
  `barrier=city_wall`. (#3745)

- Support new Tibetan font name (#3842)

  Noto has renamed Noto Sans Tibetan to Noto Serif Tibetan. The old name is
  still supported.

- Add adjustments for `highway=motorway` and `highway=service` width at z20 (#3763)

- Code cleanups to increase reuse and improve consistency (#3735, #3760, #3771, #3773, #3774)

## [v4.21.0](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/compare/v4.20.0...v4.21.0) - 2019-05-01
## Major changes
- Removed unused `world_boundaries-spherical.tgz` file from scripts

  This file can be safely removed and has not been used for some time.

- Switch to osmdata.openstreetmap.de for water & icesheet shapefiles

  The script will handle the change automatically, but if manually downloading
  or using a different method, you will need to adjust paths.

- Change from land to ocean polygons and render water areas above landcover

- Started using ST_PointOnSurface for some label placements

  These changes are part of an effort to make it easier for forks using a
  vector tile architecture as well as reducing the duplication among POI
  layers. Some load has been shifted from Mapnik to the database.

- Adjusted index for military areas

  The query was adjusted last version but the index was missed. The old
  `planet_osm_polygon_military` can be removed, and for servers in use, the new
  one can be taken from the `scripts/indexes.py --concurrent` output.

## Changes
- Adjusted starting zooms for labeling of administrative areas.

  The new zooms are based on `admin_level` and size.

- Revert rendering of healthcare key

  The original PR which implemented this had technical issues that prevented it
  from working properly.

- Stop place some place labels when the objects become too big or at high
  zooms.
- Only render capes as points and render them like other points.
- Only render ferry lines from ways, not relations
- Improved developer internal documentation

- Various other bug fixes.

## [v2.34.0](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/compare/v2.33.0...v2.34.0) - 2015-08-28
### Changes
Changes include

- better rendering for highway=path/footway/cycleway - this is the
next iteration of improving how footways and cycleways are
displayed. Unpaved footways are now visible on natural=bare_rock
and there are now three classes: paved, unpaved and unknown surface

- `man_made=bridge` is now rendered

- new rendering for `landuse=quarry`

- `amenity=veterinary` is now rendered

- `amenity=community_centre` is now rendered

- `amenity=prison` and `landuse=military` rendering takes in account area size

- consistent color for boundaries

- tweaked zoom level for `amenity=car_sharing` and `amenity=car_rental`

- Mapnik 3 preparations are now finished. The style now supports Mapnik 3. Most of the work was done on the Mapnik side.

## [v2.33.0](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/compare/v2.32.0...v2.33.0) - 2015-08-14
### Major changes
- A randomized symbology for forests for `natural=wood` and `landuse=forest`

  A long time in the works, this improvement has finally landed. The two
  tags were merged - they are indistinguishable to the data consumer.
  A randomized symbology was first suggested by SK53 at SOTM-EU 2014,
  and this feature would not have happened without his extensive research,
  or imagico's tools for creating an irregular but uniformly distributed
  and periodic dot pattern

- Unification of footway/path and rendering surface of them

   The mess that is highway=path is well-known, and it is necessary
   to do some kind of processing as a data consumer. A distinction is
   now made between paved and unpaved footways.


### Changes
- Mapnik 3 preperations

   The style is not yet fullly tested with Mapnik 3 and we don't claim to
   support it, but several bugs were fixed. Most of the work was done on
   the Mapnik side

- Power area colour adjusted

## [v2.32.0](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/compare/v2.31.0...v2.32.0) - 2015-07-31
# New files

Shapefiles are now used for Antartic ice sheets

### Changes

- Rendering minor roads and service rail later for mid-zoom clarity

   As all residential, unclassified, and service roads in a city became
   mapped the rendered view became over-crowded, bloblike, and difficult
   to read.

- Rendering of Antartic ice sheets from shapefiles

  Ice sheets in Antartica are a bit of a special case, and pre-generated
  shapefiles are now used

- No longer rendering proposed roads

- Better place label order

- meadow/grassland and orchard/vineyard color unification

- Render educational area borders later

- New POI icons
