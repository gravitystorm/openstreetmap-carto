Pattern file for allotments was generated in two steps.

SVG file is generated using JSDotPattern generator (http://www.imagico.de/map/jsdotpattern.php) using these options:

- symbol definition: pixel
  - offset: 8 8
  - scale: 0.25
- symbol pattern (foreground color): #f2faeb
- point generation
  - distance: 4
  - regular square dot pattern
- rendering: render (px aligned)
- pattern size: 64

(direct link: x,64,jdp34225;gs,4,32,32;rd,1,0,0,pixel,0.25,8,8,0,jdp4911,f2faeb,cdebb0;)

This generates file allotments.svg

However, since SVG files are not properly handled by Mapnik, the file was converted to png with alpha channel: symbols/allotments.png
