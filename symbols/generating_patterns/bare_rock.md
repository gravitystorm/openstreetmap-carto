Pattern file for bare_rock is generated in 2 steps.

For the pattern visit [jsdotpattern (command sequence is recorded)](http://www.imagico.de/map/jsdotpattern.php#x,256,jdp18277;g,5,32,32;rx,25,2,32,32;rx,25,2,32,32;rx,25,2,32,32;rx,25,2,32,32;rx,25,2,32,32;rd,0,0,1,rock,0.1,24,24,0,jdp75459,8a99a5,eee5dc;)

Generate file - use "render" followed by using "get pattern SVG data" (it is expected that background will be transparent, background colour in jsdotpattern is only for display).

However, since SVG patterns is not properly handled by Mapnik at this time, the SVG file was converted to a PNG file with alpha channel, allotments.png
