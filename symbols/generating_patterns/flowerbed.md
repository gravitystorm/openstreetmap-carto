The rendering for the flowerbed is split into two patterns: one for mid-zoom levels, and one for high zoom levels.

### Flowerbed mid zoom
The pattern is generated using [jsdotpattern (command sequence is recorded)](https://imagico.de/map/jsdotpattern.php#x,128,jdp47459;gv,6,32,32;tr;ts;rd,0,0,0,dot,0.125,4,4,0,jdp75205,eef6c0,cdebb0;).

Generated SVG image is sanitized for use with Mapnik by the script svg_pattern.sh from the jsdotpattern repository at http://github.com/imagico/jsdotpattern.

The final file is `flowerbed_mid_zoom.svg`

### Flowerbed high zoom
The pattern is generated using [jsdotpattern (command sequence is recorded)](https://imagico.de/map/jsdotpattern.php#x,128,jdp62563;gv,15,32,32;tr;rd,0,0,0,flower1,1,5,5,0,jdp49618,eef6c0,cdebb0;).

Generated SVG image is sanitized for use with Mapnik by the script svg_pattern.sh from the jsdotpattern repository at http://github.com/imagico/jsdotpattern.
