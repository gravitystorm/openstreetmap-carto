For the pattern for scrub type visit [jsdotpattern (command sequence is recorded)](http://www.imagico.de/map/jsdotpattern.php#x,512,jdp60679;g,24,64,64;rx,25,2,64,64;rx,25,2,64,64;rx,25,2,64,64;rx,25,2,64,64;rd,1,1,0,scrub2,1,5,5,0,jdp97432,b0be93,c8d7ab;)

The result is this following [pattern](http://www.imagico.de/map/jsdotpattern.php#x,512,jdp60679;g,24,64,64;rx,25,2,64,64;rx,25,2,64,64;rx,25,2,64,64;rx,25,2,64,64;rd,1,1,0,scrub2,1,5,5,0,jdp97432,b0be93,c8d7ab;).

Generated SVG image is sanitized for use with Mapnik by the script svg_pattern.sh from the jsdotpattern repository at http://github.com/imagico/jsdotpattern.

The final file is scrub.svg

Because of a [problem in the rendering stack](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues/2750) we donâ€™t use the SVG directly, but convert it to PNG: see symbols/scrub.png
