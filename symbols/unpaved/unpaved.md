Base pattern file for unpaved roads is generated in two steps.

In the first step visit [jsdotpattern (command sequence is recorded)](www.imagico.de/map/jsdotpattern.php#x,64,jdp59980;g,2.25,16,16;rx,250,2,8,8;rx,250,2,8,8;s,jdp58799;s,jdp49103;rx,250,2,8,8;rx,250,2,8,8;s,jdp94534;rx,250,2,8,8;rd,0,0,1,scree,0.07,5,10,0,jdp40148,0000ff,ffffff;)

Use "get pattern SVG data" (it is expected that background will be transparent, background colour in jsdotpattern is only for display).

Generated SVG image is sanitized for use with Mapnik by the script svg_pattern.sh from the jsdotpattern repository at http://github.com/imagico/jsdotpattern. The sanitized file is then edited manually, and the <rect> element is put above the <path> element. The file is saved as unpaved.svg.

From sanitized base SVG file (unpaved.svg), the coloured SVG versions are created. Just create a copy of the file, and within the SVG code replace fill:#0000ff with the actual foreground colour and fill:none with the actual background colour. This can be done automatically with scripts/generate_unpaved_patterns.py.
