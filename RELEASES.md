# Release process

Throughout this document, replace $OLD_VERSION with the previous release and $NEW_VERSION with the next one. Versions should start with a v, e.g. `v2.40.0`.

# Deciding to release

1. Update your local master branch
2. Review the changes in git since the last release with a command like `git log --graph $OLD_VERSION...master` or online at https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/compare/$OLD_VERSION...master
3. Review [pull requests](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/pulls) for anything that should be merged before release
4. Check [`preview.png`](preview.png) and update it if needed. Preferred way is to import current Chicago data, export new image (for example from Kosmtik via [this link](http://127.0.0.1:6789/openstreetmap-carto/export/?showExtent=true&format=png&width=849&height=310&scale=1&zoom=15&bounds=-87.65145778656006%2C41.86914537674214%2C-87.61502265930177%2C41.8790515319021)) and upload as new version of this file

Decide among the maintainers if a new release is due.

# Tagging a release
1. Check out master with git
2. Change the Unreleased section in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) to the new version. Add any changes that are missing from the changelog and a new Unreleased section.
3. Commit the changelog changes and tag a release with `git tag -a $NEW_VERSION -m "Tag $NEW_VERSION"`. *Optional: Add `-s` and GPG sign the tag.*
4. Push the tag with `git push origin $NEW_VERSION`. If you use a different name for the gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto remote, use it instead.
5. If there are any long-running development branches check them out and merge the new release with `git merge $NEW_RELEASE`.

stylesheet on the OSM website) has been released. Once changes are deployed
on the openstreetmap.org it will take couple of days before all tiles
show the new rendering.

If the tile server admins have rolled out the new version, change it to:
