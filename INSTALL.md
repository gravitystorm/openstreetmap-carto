# Installation

## OpenStreetMap data
You need OpenStreetMap data loaded into a PostGIS database (see below for [dependencies](#dependencies)). These stylesheets currently work only with the osm2pgsql defaults (i.e. database name is `gis`, table names are `planet_osm_point`, etc).

It's probably easiest to grab an PBF of OSM data from [Mapzen](https://mapzen.com/metro-extracts/) or [geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/). Once you've set up your PostGIS database, import with osm2pgsql:

```
osm2pgsql -d gis ~/path/to/data.osm.pbf --style openstreetmap-carto.style
```

You can find a more detailed guide to setting up a database and loading data with osm2pgsql at [switch2osm.org](http://switch2osm.org/loading-osm-data/).

### Custom indexes
Custom indexes are not required, but will speed up rendering, particularly for full planet databases, heavy load, or other production environments. They will not be as helpful with development using small extracts.

```
psql -d gis -f indexes.sql
```

Additionally you need some shapefiles.

## Scripted download

To download the shapefiles you can run the following script from this directory. No further steps should be needed as the data has been processed and placed in the requisite directories.

```
./get-shapefiles.sh
```

## Manual download

You can also download them manually at the following paths:

* [`simplified-land-polygons.shp`](http://data.openstreetmapdata.com/simplified-land-polygons-complete-3857.zip) (updated daily)
* [`land-polygon.shp`](http://data.openstreetmapdata.com/land-polygons-split-3857.zip) (updated daily)
* [`builtup_area.shp`](http://planet.openstreetmap.org/historical-shapefiles/world_boundaries-spherical.tgz)
* [`ne_110m_admin_0_boundary_lines_land.shp`](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/110m/cultural/ne_110m_admin_0_boundary_lines_land.zip)

The repeated www.naturalearthdata.com in the Natural Earth shapefiles is correct.

Put these shapefiles at `path/to/openstreetmap-carto/data`.

## Fonts
The stylesheet depends on a number of openly licensed fonts for support of all the languages found on the map. The package which supplies these fonts on Ubuntu is indicated.

If a font is missing, it will skip to the next available font which contains those characters. If you are not concerned with a particular language, you do not need its fonts. DejaVu Sans and Unifont are the two required fonts, and included on most systems.

### Global
* DejaVu Sans, for most languages (`ttf-dejavu`)
* Droid Sans Fallback, as a reasonable fallback (`fonts-droid`)
* Unifont, as a last resort fallback (`ttf-unifont`)

### Southeast Asia
* Arundina Sans, for Thai (`fonts-sipa-arundina`)
* Padauk, for Burmese (`fonts-sil-padauk`)
* Khmer OS Metal Chrieng Regular, for Khmer (`fonts-khmeros`)

### South Asia

* Mukti Narrow, for Bangali (`ttf-indic-fonts-core`)
* Gargi Medium, for Devanagari (`ttf-indic-fonts-core`)
* TSCu_Paranar, for Tamil (`ttf-tamil-fonts` or ``fonts-taml-tscu``, depending on your Ubuntu version)
* Mallige, for Kannada (`ttf-indic-fonts-core` for normal and bold and `ttf-kannada-fonts` for oblique) *The filename uses "Malige" but the font name uses "Mallige"*

On Ubuntu you can install all the fonts with

```
sudo apt-get install ttf-dejavu fonts-droid ttf-unifont fonts-sipa-arundina fonts-sil-padauk fonts-khmeros \
ttf-indic-fonts-core fonts-taml-tscu ttf-kannada-fonts
```
In Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy) and lower, replace fonts-taml-tscu with ttf-tamil-fonts.

## Dependencies

For development, a style design studio is needed.
* [Kosmtik](https://github.com/kosmtik/kosmtik) - Kosmtik can be launched with `node index.js serve path/to/openstreetmap-carto/project.yaml`
* [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill) - This is a TileMill project you can copy (or symlink) directly into your Mapbox/project directory

For deployment, `carto` and Mapnik are required.

* [carto](https://github.com/mapbox/carto) >= 0.9.5 (we're using instances with cascading rules and min/max zoom properties)
* [mapnik](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/wiki/Mapnik-Installation) >= 2.1.0. Mapnik 3.0 is supported, but not required.

---

For both development and deployment, a database and some utilities are required

* [osm2pgsql](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql) to [import your data](https://switch2osm.org/loading-osm-data/) into a PostGIS database
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)
* [PostGIS](http://postgis.org/)
* `curl` and `unzip` for downloading and decompressing files
* shapeindex (a companion utility to Mapnik found in the mapnik-utils package) for indexing downloaded shapefiles

### Development dependencies

Some colours, SVGs and other files are generated with helper scripts. Not all users will need these dependencies

* Python and Ruby to run helper scripts
* [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML) if editing the MML (layer definition) file (packaged as `python-yaml` on Ubuntu, or installed with `pip install pyyaml`)
* [Color Math](https://github.com/gtaylor/python-colormath) and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) if running generate_road_colors.py helper script (may be obtained with `pip install colormath numpy`)
