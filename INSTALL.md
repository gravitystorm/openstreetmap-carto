# Installation

This document describes how to manually configure your system for running OpenStreetMap Carto. If you prefer quick, platform independent setup for a development environment, without the need to install and configure tools by hand, follow a Docker installation guide in [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md).

## OpenStreetMap data
You need OpenStreetMap data loaded into a PostGIS database (see below for [dependencies](#dependencies)). These stylesheets expect a database generated with osm2pgsql using the flex backend.

Start by creating a database, we are using the database name `gis` here:

```sh
sudo -u postgres createuser -s $USER
createdb gis
```

Enable PostGIS and hstore extensions with

```sh
psql -d gis -c 'CREATE EXTENSION postgis; CREATE EXTENSION hstore;'
```

Then, grab some OSM data; It's probably easiest to grab an PBF of OSM data from [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/). Once you've done that, import with osm2pgsql:

```sh
osm2pgsql -O flex -S openstreetmap-carto-flex.lua -d gis ~/path/to/data.osm.pbf
```

You can find a more detailed guide to setting up a database and loading data with osm2pgsql at [switch2osm.org](https://switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/manually-building-a-tile-server-16-04-2-lts/).

### Disable JIT

We do not recommend [PostgreSQL JIT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/jit-reason.html), which is on by default in PostgreSQL 12 and higher. JIT is beneficial for slow queries where executing the SQL takes substantial time and that time is not spent in function calls. This is not the case for rendering, where most time is spent either fetching from disk, in PostGIS functions, or the query is fast. In theory, the query planner will only use JIT on slower queries, but it is known to get the type of queries map rendering requires wrong.

Disabling JIT is **essential** for use with Kosmtik and other style development tools.

JIT can be disabled with `psql -d gis -c 'ALTER SYSTEM SET jit=off;' -c 'SELECT pg_reload_conf();'` or any other means of adjusting the PostgreSQL config.

### Custom indexes
Custom indexes are required for rendering performance and are essential on full planet databases. These are generated by the `scripts/indexes.py` script, see `scripts/indexes.py --help` for various advanced options, but the command below will work to create the indexes on a new installation:

```sh
psql -d gis -f indexes.sql
```

The indexes can be created in parallel with

```sh
scripts/indexes.py -0 | xargs -0 -P0 -I{} psql -d gis -c "{}"
```

### Database functions
Some functions need to be loaded into the database for current versions. These can be added / re-loaded at any point using:

```sh
psql -d gis -f functions.sql
```

## Scripted download
Some features are rendered using preprocessed shapefiles.

To download them and import them into the database you can run the following script:

```sh
scripts/get-external-data.py
```

The script downloads shapefiles, loads them into the database, and sets up the tables for rendering. Additional script options and corresponding documentation is available by invoking `scripts/get-external-data.py --help`.

## Fonts
The stylesheet uses Noto, an openly licensed font family from Google with support for multiple scripts. The stylesheet uses Noto's "Sans" style where available. If not available, this stylesheet uses another appropriate style from the Noto family. The "UI" version is used where available, as its vertical metrics fit better with Latin text.

Hanazono is used a fallback for seldom used CJK characters that are not covered by Noto.

For more details, see the documentation at [fonts.mss](style/fonts.mss).

To download the fonts, run the following script

```
scripts/get-fonts.py
```

## Dependencies

To display *any* map, a database containing OpenStreetMap data and some utilities are required:
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/)
* [`osm2pgsql`](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql#installing)>=`1.8.0` to [import your data](https://switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/updating-as-people-edit-osm2pgsql-replication/) into a PostGIS database
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with the `psycopg2`, `pyyaml`, and `requests` libraries (`python3-psycopg2`, `python3-pyyaml`, `python3-requests` packages on Debian-derived systems)
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages --user pyyaml requests psycopg2
  ```
* [`ogr2ogr`](https://gdal.org/en/latest/download.html) for loading shapefiles into the database (`gdal-bin` on Debian-derived systems)

### For development (style design studio)

* [Kosmtik](https://github.com/kosmtik/kosmtik)
  * Install it:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/kosmtik/kosmtik
      cd kosmtik
      npm install
      ```
    * _The 0.0.17 release of Kosmtik wouldn't be enough because we need up-to-date CartoCSS and Mapnik versions._
  * Launch it:
      ```bash
      node index.js serve path/to/openstreetmap-carto/project.mml
      ```
* [TileMill](https://tilemill-project.github.io/tilemill/)
  * Not officially supported, but you may be able to use a recent TileMill version by copying or symlinking the project directly into your Mapbox/project directory.

#### Optional

Some colours, SVGs and other files are generated with helper scripts. Not all users will need these dependencies.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [`generate_road_colours.py`](./scripts/generate_road_colours.py) and [`generate_unpaved_patterns.py`](./scripts/generate_unpaved_patterns.py) depend on [Color Math](https://github.com/gtaylor/python-colormath) and [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/). To install these, run:
    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages --user colormath numpy
    ```

### For deployment

CartoCSS and Mapnik are required for deployment.

* [CartoCSS](https://github.com/mapbox/carto) >= `1.2.0` *(we're using YAML)*
* [Mapnik](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/wiki/Mapnik-Installation) >= `3.0.22`

With CartoCSS, these sources are compiled into a Mapnik compatible XML file. When running CartoCSS, specify the Mapnik API version you are using (at least 3.0.22: `carto -a "3.0.22"`).
