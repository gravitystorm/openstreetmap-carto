# Installation

## OpenStreetMap data
You need OpenStreetMap data loaded into a PostGIS database (see below for [dependencies](#dependencies)). These stylesheets currently work only with the osm2pgsql defaults (i.e. database name is `gis`, table names are `planet_osm_point`, etc).

Before loading the data, install the hstore extension into the database:

```
psql -d gis -c "CREATE EXTENSION hstore;"
```

It's probably easiest to grab an PBF of OSM data from [Mapzen](https://mapzen.com/metro-extracts/) or [geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/). Once you've set up your PostGIS database, import with osm2pgsql:

```
osm2pgsql -G --hstore -d gis ~/path/to/data.osm.pbf --style openstreetmap-carto.style --tag-transform-script openstreetmap-carto.lua
```

You can find a more detailed guide to setting up a database and loading data with osm2pgsql at [switch2osm.org](http://switch2osm.org/loading-osm-data/).

### Custom indexes
Custom indexes are not required, but will speed up rendering, particularly for full planet databases, heavy load, or other production environments. They will not be as helpful with development using small extracts.

```
psql -d gis -f indexes.sql
```

Additionally you need some shapefiles.

## Scripted download

To download the shapefiles you can run the following script from this directory. No further steps should be needed as the data has been processed and placed in the requisite directories.

```
./get-shapefiles.sh
```

## Manual download

You can also download them manually at the following paths:

* [`simplified-land-polygons.shp`](http://data.openstreetmapdata.com/simplified-land-polygons-complete-3857.zip) (updated daily)
* [`land-polygon.shp`](http://data.openstreetmapdata.com/land-polygons-split-3857.zip) (updated daily)
* [`builtup_area.shp`](http://planet.openstreetmap.org/historical-shapefiles/world_boundaries-spherical.tgz)
* [`ne_110m_admin_0_boundary_lines_land.shp`](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/110m/cultural/ne_110m_admin_0_boundary_lines_land.zip)

The repeated www.naturalearthdata.com in the Natural Earth shapefiles is correct.

Put these shapefiles at `path/to/openstreetmap-carto/data`.

## Fonts
The stylesheet uses Noto Sans, an openly licensed font from Google with support for multiple scripts. The "UI" version is used where available, with its vertical metrics which fit better with Latin text. Other fonts from the Noto family are used for some other languages.

DejaVu Sans is used as an optional fallback font for systems without Noto Sans. If all the Noto fonts are installed, it should never be used.

Unifont is used as a last resort fallback, with it's excellent coverage, common presence on machines, and ugly look.

On Ubuntu 16.04 or Debian Testing you can install all required fonts with

```
sudo apt-get install fonts-noto-cjk fonts-noto-hinted fonts-noto-unhinted ttf-unifont
```

DejaVu is packaged as `fonts-dejavu-core`.

### Non-latin scripts

For proper rendering of non-latin scripts, particularly those with complicated diacritics and tone marks the requirements are

* Mapnik 3

* FreeType 2.6.2 or later for CJK characters

* A recent enough version of Noto with coverage for the scripts needed.

## Dependencies

For development, a style design studio is needed.
* [Kosmtik](https://github.com/kosmtik/kosmtik) - Kosmtik can be launched with `node index.js serve path/to/openstreetmap-carto/project.yaml`
* [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill) - This is a TileMill project you can copy (or symlink) directly into your Mapbox/project directory

For deployment, `carto` and Mapnik are required.

* [carto](https://github.com/mapbox/carto) >= 0.9.5 (we're using instances with cascading rules and min/max zoom properties)
* [mapnik](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/wiki/Mapnik-Installation) >= 2.1.0. Mapnik 3.0 is supported, but not required.

---

For both development and deployment, a database and some utilities are required

* [osm2pgsql](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql) to [import your data](https://switch2osm.org/loading-osm-data/) into a PostGIS database
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)
* [PostGIS](http://postgis.org/)
* `curl` and `unzip` for downloading and decompressing files
* shapeindex (a companion utility to Mapnik found in the mapnik-utils package) for indexing downloaded shapefiles

### Development dependencies

Some colours, SVGs and other files are generated with helper scripts. Not all users will need these dependencies

* Python and Ruby to run helper scripts
* [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML) if editing the MML (layer definition) file (packaged as `python-yaml` on Ubuntu, or installed with `pip install pyyaml`)
* [Color Math](https://github.com/gtaylor/python-colormath) and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) if running generate_road_colors.py helper script (may be obtained with `pip install colormath numpy`)
