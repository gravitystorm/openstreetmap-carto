# This is the osm2pgsql .style file for openstreetmap-carto.
# It is intended to be used with openstreetmap-carto.lua and osm2pgsql Lua
# transforms. Full usage details are in INSTALL.md
# Among things, this means that the linear vs polygon distinction in this file
# doesn't matter, because that is set in the Lua and this file is only used for
# column names and types.
