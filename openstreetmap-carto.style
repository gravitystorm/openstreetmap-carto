# This is the default osm2pgsql .style file that comes with osm2pgsql.
#
# A .style file has 4 columns that define how OSM objects end up in tables in
# the database and what columns are created. It interacts with the command-line
# hstore options.
#
# Columns
# =======
#
# OsmType: This is either "node", "way" or "node,way" and indicates if this tag
# applies to nodes, ways, or both.
#
# Tag: The tag
#
# DataType: The type of the column to be created. Normally "text"
#
# Flags: Flags that indicate what table the OSM object is moved into.
#
# There are 5 possible flags. These flags are used both to indicate if a column
# should be created, and if ways with the tag are assumed to be areas. The area
# assumptions can be overridden with an area=yes/no tag
#
# polygon - Create a column for this tag, and objects the tag with are areas
#
# linear - Create a column for this tag
#
# phstore - Don't create a column for this tag, but objects with the tag are areas
#
# delete - Drop this tag completely and don't create a column for it. This also
# prevents the tag from being added to hstore columns
#
# nocache - Deprecated and does nothing
#
# If an object has a tag that indicates it is an area or has area=yes/1,
# osm2pgsql will try to turn it into an area. If it succeeds, it places it in
# the polygon table. If it fails (e.g. not a closed way) it places it in the
# line table.
#
# Nodes are never placed into the polygon or line table and are always placed in
# the point table.
#
# Hstore
# ======
#
# The options --hstore, --hstore-match-only, and --hstore-all interact with
# the .style file.
#
# With --hstore any tags without a column will be added to the hstore column.
# This will also cause all objects to be kept.
#
# With --hstore-match-only the behavior for tags is the same, but objects are
# only kept if they have a non-NULL value in one of the columns.
#
# With --hstore-all all tags are added to the hstore column unless they appear
# in the style file with a delete flag, causing duplication between the normal
# columns and the hstore column.
#
# Special database columns
# ========================
#
# There are some special database columns that if present in the .style file
# will be populated by osm2pgsql.
#
# These are
#
# z_order - datatype int4
#
# way_area - datatype real. The area of the way, in the units of the projection
# (e.g. square mercator meters). Only applies to areas
#
# osm_user, osm_uid, osm_version, osm_timestamp - datatype text. Used with the
# --extra-attributes option to include metadata in the database. If importing
# with both --hstore and --extra-attributes the meta-data will end up in the
# tags hstore column regardless of the style file.

# Deleted tags
# These are tags that are generally regarded as useless for most rendering.
# Most of them are from imports or intended as internal information for mappers
# Some of them are automatically deleted by editors.
# If you want some of them, perhaps for a debugging layer, just delete the lines.

# These tags are used by mappers to keep track of data.
# They aren't very useful for rendering.
